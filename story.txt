Once upon a time in the mystical land of Shangrila there dwelt an immortal named Kai-Yun and his trusty band of ninja monkeys. The name of his monkeys were Raphael, Donatello, and Leonardo, and Michaelangelo. They napped when they could, because ninja monkeys get tired a lot. The thing about these monkeys was that they enjoyed pizza delivery. Only delivery though. They would not eat pick up pizza because that was gross to them.
