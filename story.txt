Once upon a time in the mystical land of Shangrila there dwelt an immortal named Kai-Yun and his trusty band of ninja monkeys. The name of his monkeys were Raphael, Donatello, Leonardo, and Michaelangelo. They napped when they could, because ninja monkeys get tired a lot. The thing about these monkeys was that they enjoyed pizza delivery. Only delivery though. They would not eat pick up pizza because that was gross to them. They loved to eat pizza from Little Caesars. Deep dish. Mmmmmmm. They loved coding too. Code code code!
