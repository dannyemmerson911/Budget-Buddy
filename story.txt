Once upon a time in the mystical land of Downtown Detroit there dwelt an immortal named David and his students. The name of his students were Raphael, Donatello, Leonardo, and Michaelangelo. They napped when they could, because ninja students get tired a lot. The thing about these students was that they enjoyed pizza delivery. Only delivery though. They would not eat pick up pizza because that was gross to them. They loved to eat pizza from Little Caesars. Deep dish. Mmmmmmm. They loved coding too. Code code code! In fact, oneo of the ninjas was nicknamed Codey for his aptitude in the art of programming. Yes, these students were able to operate a computer. I'm not lying.
